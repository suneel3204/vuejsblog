      <h3>Travelling</h3>
      <p>When I first got into travel blogging, the way to make
         money was by selling links and having 40-50 niche websites with Google adwords ads.
          Press trips didn’t exist for bloggers and getting paid for our work was tough.

Then came the dawn of the influencer. The industry blossomed in
 opportunity and things were going pretty well until BOOM, the cooties hit.

So now that the game has changed drastically again, how is it
 possible to make money with a travel blog going into 2021?

I’m here to tell
 you it’s still totally possible to thrive in this role, 
 provided you’re ready to put in the hard work and most importantly,
  passion.</p><br>

         We all know what a tough year it’s been. At this year’s meeting 
         of the American Geophysical Union (AGU), however, it’s been great to see so much hope delivered by science,
          to see how much discovery and enthusiasm for exploring our world and our universe continue no matter what.

     <h3>Waterfalls</h3>

       Vijayawada is a very beautiful city located in the south eastern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It has earned its fair share of recognition and reputation along the way for its hospitality and of course owing to its amazing attractions
        that it offers. It houses the very sacred and ornate Kanaka Durga Temple which is set atop a hill graciously overlooking the city
